### Debian Installers
amd64 .deb installers can be downloaded from our [releases](https://github.com/needle-and-thread/vocal/releases) page. Please note: this method is highly discouraged. With the benefits of sandboxing, improved security, and greater simplicity, we are moving away from older installation methods. ** Also, please note that our stable and daily PPAs will be abandoned in the near future.

### Official OS packages
We're working with a number of distributions to provide official vocal packages as part of the OS. Stay tuned for more information.
